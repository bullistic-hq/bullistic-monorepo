 * Merges GraphQL schemas that are found in `packages/frontend`.

 * Apollo server's remote schema) with the Hasura Relay GraphQL API
 * (which exposes Connections on plural return types).
 *
 * See https://github.com/bullistic-hq/bullistic-monorepo/pull/143
 * for more details on why this is necessary.
 *
 * This script should primarily be run by running the yarn script:
 *   `yarn gen-graphql`
