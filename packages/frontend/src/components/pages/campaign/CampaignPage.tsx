/**
 * Why do we need this wrapper component?
 *
 * We ran two pilot campaigns with Robbie Shilstone and Popheadz, and in order to build the pilots faster, we didn't fully build out the backend.
 *
 * The backend (data model + new GraphQL API) is now built out, but we still need to support the old campaign page for our two pilot campaigns:
 * - https://bullistic.xyz/@shilstone_arts/campaigns/off-leash
 * - Popheadz
 *
 * Eventually we may want to migrate those campaigns to use the new data model and APIs, but for now, making this wrapper
 * component is the easiest way to support both the old and new campaign pages.
